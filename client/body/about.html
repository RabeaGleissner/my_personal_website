            <p>Junior web developer based in London.</p>
            <p>I just completed a 12 week full-time web development bootcamp course at General Assembly. All day, every day. Evenings, weekends, always. </p>
            <p> I learnt a huge amount including Ruby on Rails, rspec, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Meteor, HTML5, CSS3, HAML, SCSS. I used databases like PostgreSQL, sqlite and MongoDB and worked with Git and Github.</p>
            <p>It was an amazing experience. Possibly the hardest thing I've ever done but I would do it again any time.</p>
            <p>My previous career was in digital marketing where I managed web development projects, created online marketing campaigns, optimised SEO, policed brand guidelines and measured ROI. I'm changing careers because I've always had an interest in programming, love figuring out the solution to a problem and prefer getting stuck in any day over managing the creating of something.</p>
