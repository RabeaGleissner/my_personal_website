            <p>Junior web developer based in London.</p>
            <p>I just completed a 12 week full-time web development bootcamp course at General Assembly. All day, every day. Evenings, weekends, always. </p>
            <p> I learnt a huge amount including Ruby on Rails, rspec, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Meteor, HTML5, CSS3, HAML and SCSS. I used databases like PostgreSQL, sqlite and MongoDB and worked with Git and Github.</p>
            <p>It was an amazing experience. Possibly the hardest thing I've ever done but I would do it again any time.</p>
            <p>My background is in digital marketing where I managed web development projects, optimised SEO, talked social media strategies and measured ROI. I worked a lot with developers and their work seemed a lot more interesting than mine, so I decided to become a developer myself.</p>
            <p>I have two blogs:</p>
            <p><a href="http://rabeameetscode.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Rabea meets code</a> - blog about my journey to become a web developer</p> <p> <a href="http://hellorabea.com" target="_blank">hellorabea.com</a> - my travel and lifestyle blog</p>
