            <p>I'm a junior web developer based in London, currently working as a front end developer writing JavaScript, jQuery, SCSS and HTML.</p>
            <p>I previously completed a 12 week full-time web development bootcamp course at General Assembly. During this intensive course I built projects using Ruby on Rails, rspec, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, Meteor, HTML5, CSS3, HAML and SCSS. I used databases like PostgreSQL and worked with Git.</p>
            <p>My first career was in digital marketing where I managed web development projects, optimised SEO, talked social media strategies and measured ROI. I've worked a lot with developers and always felt that their work seemed a lot more satisfying than mine, so I decided to become a developer myself.</p>
            <p>I have two blogs:</p>
            <p><a href="http://rabeameetscode.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Rabea meets code</a> - blog about my journey to become a web developer</p> <p> <a href="http://hellorabea.com" target="_blank">hellorabea.com</a> - my travel and lifestyle blog</p>
