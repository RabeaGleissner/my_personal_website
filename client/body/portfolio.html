    <h1>Projects I've been working on</h1>
    <p>Here is a selection of projects I created since I started the General Assembly Web Development Immersive bootcamp back in November 2014. </p>
    <p>Please bear in mind that I'm only starting out and some of them are only tested in Google Chrome. I take no responsibility for what happens in other browsers!</p>
